I am a passionate and highly motivated student at [Hexlet](https://ru.hexlet.io/pages/about).After a successful 5-year career in Hospitality, I decided to switch my career to a different field.I found IT and Frontend development to be the most suitable environment for me right now. I am a hard worker and always strive to see the results of my work and be proud of it. Therefore, Frontend development presents a new and exciting challenge for me.

🚀**My Motivation:**

I am an open-minded individual focused on achieving results and meeting set goals. I have good self-organization skills and a strong desire to explore new areas in order to develop myself not only technically but also culturally as a person. The field of interface development and programming is new to me, but I am confident that I can excel in it and showcase my abilities based on my experience working in international teams with a strong focus on delivering exceptional results. I strive to learn the profession in order to make the most complex things simple.
