  Hi there and welcome to my shelter.
</h1>

**About me:**

My name is [Nikita](https://ru.hexlet.io/u/nesquick0_17), and I am an ex-hospitality expert and restaurant manager. Currently, I am a Frontend JS Developer. I am a passionate and highly motivated student at [Hexlet](https://ru.hexlet.io/pages/about). I am looking forward to completing my education and graduating in November 2023. After a successful 5-year career in Hospitality, I decided to switch my career to a different field. After extensive research for half a year, I found IT and Frontend development to be the most suitable environment for me right now. I am a hard worker and always strive to see the results of my work and be proud of it. Therefore, Frontend development presents a new and exciting challenge for me. 

**Knowledge and Proficiency:**

- JavaScript: Proficient in data structures, array manipulation methods, understanding of pure and impure functions, and higher-order functions.
- HTML and CSS: Proficient in the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.
- HTTP: Understanding of the HTTP protocol and its workings.
- Asynchronous Programming: Confident in working with asynchronous operations and understanding the principles of asynchronous programming.
- Automated Testing: Acquired skills in automated testing, demonstrated in two of my projects.

**Currently Learning:**

- TypeScript: Actively studying TypeScript and applying it in my projects to achieve more type-safe code.
- React.js: Currently studying and exploring React.js, learning to create components and develop projects using this library.
- Interested in firebase.

**My Motivation:**

I am an open-minded individual focused on achieving results and meeting set goals. I have good self-organization skills and a strong desire to explore new areas in order to develop myself not only technically but also culturally as a person. The field of interface development and programming is new to me, but I am confident that I can excel in it and showcase my abilities based on my experience working in international teams with a strong focus on delivering exceptional results. I strive to learn the profession in order to make the most complex things simple.
